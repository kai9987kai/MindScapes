# MindScapes

**MindScapes** is an experimental web project exploring *cognitive / psychological “mindscape”* themes through **AI-inspired worldbuilding**, **procedural textures**, and **dynamic visual layers**—currently starting as a lightweight landing page titled **“Echoes of Thought”**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What’s in this repo right now

- `README.md` – project stub (currently just the title). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- `index.html` – a minimal landing-page style entry with the “Echoes of Thought” concept description. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

At the moment, this repository is best treated as a **foundation / placeholder** for the full MindScapes experience.

## Quick start (local)

Because this is a web entrypoint, you can run it locally in any of these ways:

### Option A — open directly
- Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.

### Option B — run a tiny local web server (recommended)
Some browser features (future WebGL/WebGPU, module imports, asset loading, etc.) work better over HTTP.

Python:
```bash
cd MindScapes
python -m http.server 8000
